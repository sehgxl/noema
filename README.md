# Noema 
A chrome extension for finding the meaning of a word.

Libraries Used 
- Parcel
- React
- Vaul
  
## Why it is called noema?
The word noema in greek means mental object. Since words are mental objects, I thought the name fits the usecase for the extension.

## What are the primary features?

### Look UP
- Shows the meaning of the word along with its source in a sheet that pops from the bottom of the page.

### Find Selection
- Highlights all the words which match the selected word. (It's a regex behind the scene).

### Copy
- Copies the selected word to the keyboard.

### Search Web
- Opens a new tab with a google search of the word

## What was the inspiration to build this?
I observed that, I often used this feature in my iphone. In IOS, this is a native feature. The experience of using this feature was pretty delightful and useful. So I thought building something similar but for the web would be fun. Plus an attempt to build something apple-like is in itself a good excersie to understand how well the apple folks master the details of all their interactions.
